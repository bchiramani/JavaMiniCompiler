# Mini Java Compiler
The task at hand is to develop a Mini Java Compiler as part of a mini project. The specific tasks required for completion can be found at this link: https://www.insat.ucar.tn/GL/4/Compilation/project.


## Process

### Lexical analysis 

We need to install the needed software : flex .
Then for the purpose of creating a lexical analyser we develop lexical_analysis.lex that transform the java code into tokens .

### Syntaxic analysis 

We need to install the needed software : bison
During this step, using the syntax_analysis. we  verify the syntax of the input source code and construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) . The input of the sytax abalyser are the tokens generated by the lexical analyser

### Semantic analysis 

We need to develop a semantic analyser that evaluates the significance of the input program. We create then an executable file .The input is the abstract syntax tree produced by the parser.
